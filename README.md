## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **User adds a task** in the input box and clicks “Add”.
2. The task is displayed in a list with **Edit** and **Delete** options.
3. Tasks can be **marked as completed** by clicking the checkbox.
4. Data is stored in **localStorage** for persistence (optional).
5. The user can **edit** a task or **remove** it anytime.
